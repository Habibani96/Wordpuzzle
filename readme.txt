hello, I hope my project helps you to understand assembly language.

1)	first you need to install visual studios 10 or 13
2)	open the project file(.asm)
3)	now in .asm file you will encounter the directory error, which will be resloved by the given exact same directory(in which your word.text file is saved)
4)	now run the program.




Enjoy
